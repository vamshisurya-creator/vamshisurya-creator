## 🌍 Current Role

**Sr. Java Full Stack Developer at IQVIA **  
• SDLC: Agile | Architecture: Microservices, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) | Frameworks: Spring Boot, Spring
Security, OAuth2, JWT | Web Services: RESTful, SOAP | ORM: Hibernate, JPA | Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP.
• I've been in charge of building the core Spring Boot microservices that make all our AI magic happen. These systems
handle an incredible amount of real-time healthcare data for over 40 million users, and I'm really proud that we keep
them running flawlessly with 99.99% system uptime.
• A big part of my role is crafting and securing our RESTful APIs – making sure our AI models can talk to everything else
while keeping all that sensitive patient data locked down tight. My work here strictly adheres to HIPAA compliance
using tools like Spring Security, OAuth2, and JWT.
• On the front end, I've transformed complex AI-driven insights into really intuitive React and Angular dashboards.
Honestly, seeing those visualizations helps clinicians so much, and my optimizations actually boosted our UI
performance and user satisfaction by 25%.
• I also architected and managed some incredibly resilient asynchronous data pipelines using Kafka, RabbitMQ, and
AWS SQS. These pipelines are literally the lifeblood, taking vast healthcare datasets and getting them perfectly
prepped for AI model training and inference without a hitch.
• For deployment, I handle automating our whole cloud setup with Terraform, pushing our AI-enabled applications
onto Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE) and Docker. It all lives in IQVIA's Human Data Science Cloud across AWS, Azure,
and GCP.
• A highlight is working closely with data scientists, product managers, and clinical experts. We go through rigorous
QA and UAT together, ensuring our new AI functionalities are completely vetted. We hit 85-90% test coverage with
JUnit, Mockito, Jasmine, and Karma – quality is key.
• And to keep everything zipping along, I've really dug into optimizing SQL queries for our AI solutions in Oracle and
PostgreSQL, which actually sped up our database performance by 30%. Plus, I'm always monitoring the AI solution
performance and system health using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog to stay ahead of any issues
